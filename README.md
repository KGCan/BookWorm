## Concept
As an avid reader I want to search for new books to read so that I can keep a list of books to purchase

## Goals

- Given a book search engine
- When I load the search engine
- Then I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
- When I click on the Search for Books menu option
- Then I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button
- When I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
- Then I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site
- When I click on the Login/Signup menu option
- Then a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up
- When the toggle is set to Signup
- Then I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button
- When the toggle is set to Login
- Then I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button
- When I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button
- Then my user account is created and I am logged in to the site
- When I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button
- Then I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site
- When I am logged in to the site
- Then the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout
- When I am logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
- Then I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account
- When I click on the Save button on a book
- Then that book’s information is saved to my account
- When I click on the option to see my saved books
- Then I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account
- When I click on the Remove button on a book
- Then that book is deleted from my saved books list
- When I click on the Logout button
- Then I am logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
